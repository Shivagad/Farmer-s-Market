            Land preservation focuses on protecting and maintaining natural landscapes, agricultural lands, and ecosystems for future generations. It involves sustainable practices to prevent soil erosion, combat deforestation, conserve water resources, and promote biodiversity. By implementing strategies like controlled land use, reforestation, and soil management, land preservation helps maintain the ecological balance, support agriculture, and mitigate environmental degradation. It ensures that land remains fertile, productive, and resilient against the impacts of urbanization and climate change.
